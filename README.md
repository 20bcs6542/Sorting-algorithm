 **Sorting-algorthm**- A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements
according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide
the new order of element in the respective data structure.

** Quick Sort:** A sorting technique that sequences a list by continuously dividing the list into
two parts and moving the lower items to one side and the higher items to the other. It starts by 
picking one item in the entire list to serve as a pivot point. The pivot could be the first item 
or a randomly chosen one. All items that compare lower than the pivot are moved to the left of the
pivot; all equal or higher items are moved to the right. It then picks a pivot for the left side 
and moves those items to left and right of the pivot and continues the pivot picking and dividing
until there is only one item left in the group. It then proceeds to the right side and performs 
the same operation again. See sort algorithm.

**Merge Sort:** Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With 
worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.
Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.
